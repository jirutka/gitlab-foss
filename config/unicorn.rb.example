# Sample verbose configuration file for Unicorn (not Rack)
#
# This configuration file documents many features of Unicorn
# that may not be needed for some applications. See
# http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/unicorn.conf.minimal.rb
# for a much simpler configuration file.
#
# See http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html for complete
# documentation.

# Relative URL support
# WARNING: We recommend using an FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead
# of using a relative URL.
# Documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
# Uncomment and customize the following line to run in a non-root path
#
# ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = "/gitlab"

# Read about unicorn workers here:
