# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# GitLab application config file  #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# How to use:
# 1. Copy file as gitlab.yml
# 2. Update gitlab -> host with your fully qualified domain name
# 3. Update gitlab -> email_from
# 4. If you installed Git from source, change git -> bin_path to /usr/local/bin/git
#    IMPORTANT: If Git was installed in a different location use that instead.
#    You can check with `which git`. If a wrong path of Git is specified, it will
#     result in various issues such as failures of GitLab CI builds.
# 5. Review this configuration file for other settings you may want to adjust

  # 1. GitLab app settings
  # ==========================

  ## GitLab settings
  gitlab:
    ## Web server settings (note: host is the FQDN, do not include http://)
    host: localhost
    port: 80 # Set to 443 if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details
    https: false # Set to true if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details

    # Uncommment this line below if your ssh host is different from HTTP/HTTPS one
    # (you'd obviously need to replace ssh.host_example.com with your own host).
    # Otherwise, ssh host will be set to the `host:` value above
    # ssh_host: ssh.host_example.com

    # Relative URL support
    # WARNING: We recommend using an FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead
    # of using a relative URL.
    # Documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
    # Uncomment and customize the following line to run in a non-root path
    #
    # relative_url_root: /gitlab

    # Trusted Proxies
    # Customize if you have GitLab behind a reverse proxy which is running on a different machine.
    # Add the IP address for your reverse proxy to the list, otherwise users will appear signed in from that address.
    trusted_proxies:
      # Examples:
      #- 192.168.1.0/24
      #- 192.168.2.1
      #- 2001:0db8::/32

    # Uncomment and customize if you can't use the default user to run GitLab (default: 'git')
    # user: git

    ## Date & Time settings
    # Uncomment and customize if you want to change the default time zone of GitLab application.
    # To see all available zones, run `bundle exec rake time:zones:all RAILS_ENV=production`
    # time_zone: 'UTC'

    ## Email settings
    # Uncomment and set to false if you need to disable email sending from GitLab (default: true)
    # email_enabled: true
    # Email address used in the "From" field in mails sent by GitLab
    email_from: example@example.com
    email_display_name: GitLab
    email_reply_to: noreply@example.com
    email_subject_suffix: ''

    # Email server smtp settings are in config/initializers/smtp_settings.rb.sample

    # default_can_create_group: false  # default: true
    # username_changing_enabled: false # default: true - User can change her username/namespace

    ## Automatic issue closing
    # If a commit message matches this regular expression, all issues referenced from the matched text will be closed.
    # This happens when the commit is pushed or merged into the default branch of a project.
    # When not specified the default issue_closing_pattern as specified below will be used.
    # Tip: you can test your closing pattern at http://rubular.com.
    # issue_closing_pattern: '((?:[Cc]los(?:e[sd]?|ing)|[Ff]ix(?:e[sd]|ing)?|[Rr]esolv(?:e[sd]?|ing))(:?) +(?:(?:issues? +)?%{issue_ref}(?:(?:, *| +and +)?)|([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+-\d+))+)'

  ## LDAP settings
  # You can inspect a sample of the LDAP users with login access by running:
  #   bundle exec rake gitlab:ldap:check RAILS_ENV=production
  ldap:
    enabled: false
    servers:
      ##########################################################################
      #
      # Since GitLab 7.4, LDAP servers get ID's (below the ID is 'main'). GitLab
      # Enterprise Edition now supports connecting to multiple LDAP servers.
      #
      # If you are updating from the old (pre-7.4) syntax, you MUST give your
      # old server the ID 'main'.
      #
      ##########################################################################
      main: # 'main' is the GitLab 'provider ID' of this LDAP server
        ## label
        #
        # A human-friendly name for your LDAP server. It is OK to change the label later,
        # for instance if you find out it is too large to fit on the web page.
        #
        # Example: 'Paris' or 'Acme, Ltd.'
        label: 'LDAP'

        host: '_your_ldap_server'
        port: 389
        uid: 'uid'

        bind_dn: '_the_full_dn_of_the_user_you_will_bind_with'
        password: '_the_password_of_the_bind_user'

        # Set a timeout, in seconds, for LDAP queries. This helps avoid blocking
        # a request if the LDAP server becomes unresponsive.
        # A value of 0 means there is no timeout.
        timeout: 10

        # This setting specifies if LDAP server is Active Directory LDAP server.
        # For non AD servers it skips the AD specific queries.
        # If your LDAP server is not AD, set this to false.
        active_directory: false

        # If allow_username_or_email_login is enabled, GitLab will ignore everything
        # after the first '@' in the LDAP username submitted by the user on login.
        #
        # Example:
        # - the user enters 'jane.doe@example.com' and 'p@ssw0rd' as LDAP credentials;
        # - GitLab queries the LDAP server with 'jane.doe' and 'p@ssw0rd'.
        #
        # If you are using "uid: 'userPrincipalName'" on ActiveDirectory you need to
        # disable this setting, because the userPrincipalName contains an '@'.

        # To maintain tight control over the number of active users on your GitLab installation,

        # Note that the user's LDAP login will always be the attribute specified as `uid` above.
        attributes:

          # (like `gitlab.example.com/username/project`) and when mentioning
          # them in issues, merge request and comments (like `@username`).

    # CAUTION!
    # This allows users to login without having a user account first. Define the allowed providers
    # using an array, e.g. ["saml", "twitter"], or as true/false to allow all providers or none.
    # User accounts will be created automatically when authentication was successful.

    # Set different Omniauth providers as external so that all users creating accounts
    # via these providers will not be able to have access to internal projects. You

    # Refer to the examples below for the full names of the supported providers.
    # (default: [])
    external_providers: []

    ## Auth providers
    # Uncomment the following lines and fill in the data of the auth provider you want to use
    # If your favorite auth provider is not listed you can use others:
    # see https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-public-wiki/wiki/Custom-omniauth-provider-configurations
    # The 'app_id' and 'app_secret' parameters are always passed as the first two
    # arguments, followed by optional 'args' which can be either a hash or an array.
    # Documentation for this is available at http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/omniauth.html

  #
  # 4. Advanced settings
  # ==========================

  ## Repositories settings
  repositories:
    # Paths where repositories can be stored. Give the canonicalized absolute pathname.
    # IMPORTANT: None of the path components may be symlink, because
    # gitlab-shell invokes Dir.pwd inside the repository path and that results
    # real path not the symlink.
    storages: # You must have at least a `default` storage path.
      default:
        path: /var/lib/gitlab/repositories/
        gitaly_address: unix:/run/gitlab/gitaly.socket  # TCP connections are supported too (e.g. tcp://host:port)

  ## Backup settings
  backup:
    path: /var/tmp/gitlab/backups   # Relative paths are relative to Rails.root (default: tmp/backups/)
    # archive_permissions: 0640 # Permissions for the resulting backup.tar file (default: 0600)
    # keep_time: 604800   # default: 0 (forever) (in seconds)
    # pg_schema: public     # default: nil, it means that all schemas will be backed up

  ## GitLab Shell settings
  gitlab_shell:
    path: /usr/share/gitlab-shell/
    hooks_path: /usr/share/gitlab-shell/hooks/

    # File that contains the secret key for verifying access for gitlab-shell.

    # Git over HTTP
    upload_pack: true

    # Default is '.gitlab_workhorse_secret' relative to Rails.root (i.e. root of the GitLab app).
    secret_file: /etc/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse.secret

  ## Git settings
  # CAUTION!
  # Use the default values unless you really know what you are doing
  git:
    bin_path: /usr/bin/git
    # The next value is the maximum memory size grit can use
    # Given in number of bytes per git object (e.g. a commit)
